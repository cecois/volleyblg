### RRR
We're pretty waste-minded here at Volley HQ. In fact we've *lost* more maps of Texas' landfill capacity than most people ever even make. (One - but are we wrong?) So when one member of our team decides to clean out their bureau and [donate extraneous office supplies to Africa](https://www.developafrica.org/files/donate-supplies.pdf), it's not just all of us that do it - it's everybody we even know!

### Waste Data
We're Volley, so we're also wont to nerd this up a little. 

* waste stats
* supply class graph
* pen type chart
* pen maker chart
