### RRR
At Volley we have a long history of monitoring waste. In fact we've *lost* more maps of Texas' landfill capacity than most people ever even make. (One - but are we wrong?) So when one member of our team decides to clean out their bureau and donate extraneous office supplies to Africa, it's not just all of us that do it - it's everybody we even know!

### Donation
Here's what we're talking about:
there's an org
https://www.developafrica.org/files/donate-supplies.pdf
we're collecting
we'll send

But we're Volley, so we're also wont to nerd this up a little.
