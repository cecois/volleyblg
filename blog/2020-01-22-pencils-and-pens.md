### RRR
We're pretty waste-minded here at Volley HQ. In fact we've *lost* more maps of Texas' landfill capacity than most people ever even make. (One - but are we wrong?) So when one member of our team decides to clean out their bureau and [donate extraneous office supplies to Africa](https://www.developafrica.org/files/donate-supplies.pdf), it's not just all of us that do it - it's everybody we even know!

### Waste Data Means What?
We're also Volley, though, so we're wont to nerd this up a little with a quaint little essay about term definition. A [query at data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=waste&sort=score+desc%2C+name+asc&_groups_limit=0&_vocab_category_all_limit=0) for "waste" (spoiler alert - don't bother) initiates a very classic problem in data work: what do we mean, "waste"? It's extremely important (in data work especially) to have clearly-defined terms, and "waste" simply isn't. Hazardous waste? Medical waste? Toxic waste? Potato waste? There's plenty of waste, be sure, but most likely we're just thinking of [municipal solid waste](https://www.epa.gov/landfills/municipal-solid-waste-landfills) - the garbage from our homes and businesses to which we wave goodbye and bury in the earth.

So, ok, we shop [municipal solid waste](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=municipal+solid+waste&sort=views_recent+desc&as_sfid=AAAAAAUM5Py3kuRzwqv9-saSF5hKCwAr19zyExALetdN01V9wRhtJ_Fl_zWcFjrWw-uRnTaz7cqEr0S1MvRNnFZV0mYYyC9dpD4RoR_o--K8SuGTwThqyjhCxZK5f_Q9k5xIL7E%3D&as_fid=051d3b148bf24736c71887a2355a3ac7e36cff63&ext_location=&ext_bbox=&ext_prev_extent=-142.03125%2C8.754794702435618%2C-59.0625%2C61.77312286453146) at data.gov. Four hundred-some?! Nah, "[municipal solid waste](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=%22municipal+solid+waste%22&sort=views_recent+desc&as_sfid=AAAAAAXvrThTN4EwkivfqawYDqo9OVysVoBEpuBINAeFEA86EZ_17Ntdx6UrGxKmGAUbEMziXhTGpTrnYa6M9CLMOzniVAJJ4ef6OjXu7T7xCnlizOxQrl9XRP5F5oIWo_mPRQo%3D&as_fid=7fc42e2b397c1c66ae58762b95fb2504dcfe5b38&ext_location=&ext_bbox=&ext_prev_extent=-142.03125%2C2.4601811810210052%2C-59.0625%2C58.63121664342478)" (quoted). Eleven. That's somehow better and worse at the same time. But have a look at hit #1, [Materials in the U.S. Municipal Waste Stream, 1960 to 2012 (in tons)](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/materials-in-the-u-s-municipal-waste-stream-1960-to-2012-in-tons):

*The data in Materials and Products in the Municipal Waste Stream, 1960 to 2012, provides estimated data in thousands of tons _discarded after recycling and compost recovery_ for the years 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012. In this data set, _discards include combustion with energy recovery_. This data table _does not include construction & demolition debris, industrial process wastes, or certain other wastes_. Details may not add to totals due to rounding.*

We *still* have universe problems. Do we want to map Vermont's landfills? Do we want annual MSW totals for Pennsylvania? Ultra-high Specific Impulse Lithium-fueled Ion Thruster for Interstellar Precursor Mission Concepts? Cuz that's [available](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ultra-high-specific-impulse-lithium-fueled-ion-thruster-for-interstellar-precursor-mission), too! (This last one's a fudge -- page 21 of an unquoted search for "municipal solid waste" at data.gov -- point is the term "municipal solid waste".)

Anyway, with MSW the plethora is almost worse than the dearth. End quote. Just meaning it can happen that there are so many sources it becomes difficult to evaluate which to believe, which to use, or even what they actually mean. It's probably even *less* true of MSW data than other kinds, thanks to the relative authority of vested agencies like the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/guide-facts-and-figures-report-about-materials#Materials) and [World Bank](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/what-a-waste/).
