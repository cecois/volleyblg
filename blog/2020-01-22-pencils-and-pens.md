### RRR
We're pretty waste-minded here at Volley HQ. In fact we've *lost* more maps of Texas' landfill capacity than most people ever even make. (One - but are we wrong?) So when one member of our team decides to clean out their bureau and [donate extraneous office supplies to Africa](https://www.developafrica.org/files/donate-supplies.pdf), it's not just all of us that do it - it's everybody we even know!

### Waste Data Means What?
We're also Volley, though, so we're wont to nerd this up a little with a quaint little essay about term definition. A [query at data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=waste&sort=score+desc%2C+name+asc&_groups_limit=0&_vocab_category_all_limit=0) for "waste" (spoiler alert - don't bother) initiates a very classic problem in data work: what do we mean, "waste"? It's extremely important (in data work especially) to have clearly-defined terms, and "waste" simply isn't. Hazardous waste? Medical waste? Potato waste? Toxic waste? There's plenty of waste, be sure, but most likely we're really just thinking of [municipal solid waste](https://www.epa.gov/landfills/municipal-solid-waste-landfills) - the garbage to which we wave goodbye and bury in the earth.

So if we shop "municipal solid waste" to data.gov (or anywhere, really), we still have universe problems. Do we want to map Vermont landfills? Do we want annual totals for Pennsylvania? Ultra-high Specific Impulse Lithium-fueled Ion Thruster for Interstellar Precursor Mission Concepts? Cuz that's [available](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ultra-high-specific-impulse-lithium-fueled-ion-thruster-for-interstellar-precursor-mission), too! (This last one's a fudge -- page 21 of an unquoted search for "municipal solid waste" at data.gov -- but you get the idea.)

Anyway, with MSW the plethora is almost worse than the dearth. End quote üòè. Just meaning it can happen that there are so many sources it becomes difficult to evaluate which to believe, which to use, or even what they actually mean. It's probably even *less* true of MSW data than other kinds, thanks to the relative authority of vested agencies like the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/guide-facts-and-figures-report-about-materials#Materials) and [World Bank](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/what-a-waste/).
